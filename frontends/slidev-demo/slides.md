# Custom — read by PollPanel via useSlideContext().$slidev.configs and

# Slidev Polls

In-deck auth control + deck-token activation.

To run this deck:

1. Boot the backend (`task up:detached` or `task slidev:demo`).
2. Open `http://localhost:8080/admin/`, do first-run setup, create a poll
   with two questions and add `http://localhost:3030` to **Allowed origins**.
3. On each question hit **Copy snippet** in the editor — paste the resulting
   `<PollResults />` tags into Q1 / Q2 slides below (replacing the stubs).
4. Mint a deck token on the **Deck tokens** page; copy the plaintext token.
5. Click **sign in** in the Slidev nav bar and paste the token. The button
   flips to _signed in: &lt;label&gt;_.

## How this deck is wired

- The addon mounts a **sign-in button in the nav bar** (hover the toolbar to
  reveal it during play). Pre-sign-in the button reads _sign in_; click to
  open the token popover.
- Paste the deck token; the toolbar flips to **signed in: &lt;label&gt;**.
- Poll slides embed `<PollResults />` — on mount they POST
  `/api/deck/polls/{pollId}/activate` **only** if the composable is
  `signed-in`. Anonymous viewers never hijack the active question.
- Revoke the token from the backoffice → next navigation flips the control
  back to _not signed in_ with _credential not recognised_.

<!--
Navigate here while **signed in** to activate this question on the backend.
Open a second tab without signing in — same tallies, never fires activate.

| auth control flips to _signed in: label_ | top-right overlay              |
| activation POST with `X-Deck-Token`      | browser devtools network panel |
| anonymous viewer fires zero POSTs        | second browser profile         |
| revocation → _credential not recognised_ | first browser after DELETE     |
| _live updates paused_ on SSE drop        | kill the SSE from devtools     |
